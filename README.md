# How to Configure OpenWrt Network Settings

1. ## Enter OpenWrt shell

   ### 1st Method:

   Use Vim to edit the network configuration

   ```
   vi /etc/config/network
   ```

   How to operate in Vim:

   ```
   1) Press i to enter insert mode.
   2) Edit the LAN address.
   3) Press Esc to return to view mode.
   4) Type :wq to write the changes and quit.
   ```

   ### 2nd Method

   Use uci command to edit the network configuration

   ```
   1) uci show network
   This is to check the current network configuration.
   2) uci set network.lan.ipaddr='192.168.3.11' (whatever address you want)
   This is to change the LAN address.
   ```

2. ## Confirm the network setting changes (IMPORTANT!!!)

   ```
   uci commit
   ```

3. ## Restart the network service to apply the changes

   ```
   service network restart
   ```

4. ## Visit the LuCI page

   Visit LuCI (the web GUI for OpenWrt management) to make further configurations.

5. ## Reconnect the WAN interface, if PPPoE is used

   After setting up PPPoE, reconnect the WAN interface. Otherwise, net speed could be slower than expected.

## NB

arp

Use the 'arp' command to check clients connected to OpenWrt. This will show the MAC address, IP address, and interface (device) for all clients connected to the router.
